<h2>Fractol</h2>

Fractol is a 42 School project that challenges students to create a graphical application for exploring fractals. The goal is to implement a program that allows users to visualize various types of fractals and manipulate them in real-time. This project emphasizes graphics programming, user interface design, and mathematical concepts related to fractals.

## Usage (MacOS)
